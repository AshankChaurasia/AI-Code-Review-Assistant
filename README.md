# AI-Code-Review-Assistant
An AI-powered code review system built with FastAPI and Gemini API


## 🧠 AI Code Review Assistant
An AI-powered web application that reviews Python code for bugs, readability, and PEP8 violations.

### 🚀 Tech Stack
- **Backend:** FastAPI, Python  
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript (Gradio UI)
- **Database:** PostgreSQL / SQLite  
- **AI Integration:** Gemini API for intelligent feedback  
- **Tools:** Pylint, Flake8, Black

### ⚙️ Project Overview
The app allows users to upload `.py` files for automated code analysis.  
It combines static analysis tools with AI-generated insights to highlight:
- Bugs and undefined variables  
- Best practice suggestions  
- Readability improvements  
- Style violations  

### 💡 Development Process
- Implemented authentication and database management manually.  
- Used AI tools (ChatGPT/Copilot) for frontend scaffolding and API setup.  
- Resolved multiple debugging issues using AI-assisted troubleshooting.  
- Designed and tested backend modules independently.

> 🧩 *Note:* AI tools were used for efficiency in repetitive or UI-related sections.  
> All core logic (auth, DB, code analysis pipeline) and architecture decisions were implemented manually.
